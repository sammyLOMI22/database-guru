## 🎯 Key Documentation Themes

### 1. DuckDB as Analytics Companion

Throughout all documentation, we emphasize:
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** for production OLTP (transactions)
- **DuckDB** for analytics OLAP (aggregations, analysis)
- Using both together for optimal performance

### 2. Multi-Database Flexibility

Documented use cases:
- **Data Migration Validation** - Compare old vs new
- **Multi-Tenant Analysis** - Query across tenants
- **Environment Comparison** - Dev/staging/prod
- **Hybrid Analytics** - OLTP + OLAP combination

### 3. Ease of Use

All documentation emphasizes:
- Natural language interface (no SQL needed)
- Automatic detection of database types
- Transparent handling of sync vs async
- Same user experience regardless of database
