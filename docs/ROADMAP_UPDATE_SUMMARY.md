## Why These Recommendations?

### Query Planning Agent (RECOMMENDED)

**Why it's #1:**
- Addresses the biggest pain point: complex queries
- Natural progression after self-correction + learning
- Users will see immediate quality improvement
- Builds foundation for future agentic features

**Best for:**
- E-commerce analytics (revenue, conversion, cohorts)
- Multi-table reporting
- Complex aggregations and joins

**Example Impact:**
```
Before: "Show revenue by category for Q1 and Q2"
→ Often generates wrong SQL (missing joins, wrong filters)
→ Success rate: ~60%

After: Query Planning Agent
→ Plans: tables needed, joins, time filters, grouping
→ Generates accurate SQL from plan
→ Success rate: ~95%
```

### Result Verification Agent (QUICK WIN)

**Why it's attractive:**
- Easiest to implement (1-2 days)
- Low risk, immediate value
- Catches edge cases self-correction misses
- Great for user trust

**Best for:**
- Production deployments where quality matters
- Financial/critical queries
- Debugging query issues

**Example Impact:**
```
Before: Query returns 0 rows
→ User sees empty result
→ Doesn't know if query was wrong or data is missing

After: Result Verification
→ Agent checks: "0 rows suspicious for COUNT query"
→ Verifies table has data
→ Regenerates better query
→ Returns correct results
```

### Schema-Aware Fixes (COST SAVINGS)

**Why it's valuable:**
- 100x faster than LLM fixes
- Zero API cost for simple typos
- Perfect complement to learning
- High success rate (>95% for typos)

**Best for:**
- High-volume applications
- Cost-conscious deployments
- Fast user experience

**Example Impact:**
```
Before: "pric" typo
→ LLM call to fix (~2 seconds, $0.001)
→ Generate corrected SQL
→ Execute

After: Schema-Aware Fixes
→ Fuzzy match in schema (0.01 seconds, $0)
→ Instant correction: "pric" → "price"
→ Execute
```

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Go for Impact (Recommended)

Build **Query Planning Agent** next:

**Week 1:**
1. Design query planning prompt
2. Implement plan generation
3. Build SQL generator from plan
4. Test with complex queries

**Week 2:**
5. Integrate with existing agent
6. Add planning to multi-database queries
7. Documentation and examples
8. Deploy and measure impact

**Expected Results:**
- 4x better accuracy on complex queries
- Explainable reasoning (show plan to user)
- Foundation for future agentic features

### Option 2: Go for Quick Win

Build **Result Verification Agent** this week:

**Day 1-2:**
1. Implement suspicious result detection
2. Add verification checks
3. Integrate with self-correcting agent

**Day 3-4:**
4. Test with edge cases
5. Documentation
6. Deploy

**Expected Results:**
- Catch 80% of logical errors
- Better user trust
- Quick deployment success

### Option 3: Go for Speed Package

Build **Schema-Aware Fixes**:

**Day 1-2:**
1. Implement fuzzy matching
2. Add schema lookup for corrections
3. Integrate as fast path before LLM

**Day 3-4:**
4. Test with common typos
5. Measure speed improvements
6. Deploy

**Expected Results:**
- 90% of errors fixed instantly (with learning)
- Significant cost savings
- Great user experience
